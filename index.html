<p>I think that your choice in these is really dependant on your situation. For some people they may want to have a lot of control and power when creating their website. But for other people they may just need something basic and user friendly. If you wanted more power/control you may want to go with linux. If you want more user friendly options then m-drive or webhost would probably be your best bet. If it were up to me I would probably pick the webhost option as it is fairly easy to work with.</p>
